``np.pad`` with ``mode=wrap`` pads with strict multiples of original data
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Code based on earlier version of ``pad`` that uses  ``mode="wrap"`` will return
different results when the padding size is larger than initial array.

``np.pad`` with ``mode=wrap`` now always fills the space with 
strict multiples of original data even if the padding size is larger than the
initial array.
