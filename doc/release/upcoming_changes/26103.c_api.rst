API symbols now hidden but customizable
---------------------------------------
NumPy now defaults to hide the API symbols it adds to allow all NumPy API
usage.
This means that by default you cannot dynamically fetch the NumPy API from
another library (this was never possible on windows).

If you are experiencing linking errors related to ``PyArray_API`` or
``PyArray_RUNTIME_VERSION``, you can define the
:c:macro:`NPY_API_SYMBOL_ATTRIBUTE` to opt-out of this change.

If you are experiencing problems due to an upstream header including NumPy,
the solution is to make sure you ``#include "numpy/ndarrayobject.h"`` before
their header and import NumPy yourself based on  :ref:`including-the-c-api`.
