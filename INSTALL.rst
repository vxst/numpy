Building and installing NumPy
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**IMPORTANT**: the below notes are about building NumPy, which for most users
is *not* the recommended way to install NumPy.  Instead, use either a complete
scientific Python distribution (recommended) or a binary installer - see
https://scipy.org/install.html.

Prerequisites
=============

Building NumPy requires the following installed software:

1) Python__ 3.10.x or newer.

   Please note that the Python development headers also need to be installed,
   e.g., on Debian/Ubuntu one needs to install both `python3` and
   `python3-dev`. On Windows and macOS this is normally not an issue.

2) Cython >= 3.0.6

3) pytest__ (optional)

   This is required for testing NumPy, but not for using it.

4) Hypothesis__ (optional) 5.3.0 or later

   This is required for testing NumPy, but not for using it.

Python__ https://www.python.org/
pytest__ https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/
Hypothesis__ https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/


.. note::

   If you want to build NumPy in order to work on NumPy itself, use
   ``spin``.  For more details, see
   https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/development_environment.html

.. note::

   More extensive information on building NumPy is maintained at
   https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/building.html#building-from-source


Basic installation
==================

If this is a clone of the NumPy git repository, then first initialize
the ``git`` submodules::

    git submodule update --init

To install NumPy, run::

    pip install .

This will compile NumPy on all available CPUs and install it into the active
environment.

To run the build from the source folder for development purposes, use the
``spin`` development CLI::

    spin build    # installs in-tree under `build-install/`
    spin ipython  # drop into an interpreter where `import numpy` picks up the local build

Alternatively, use an editable install with::

    pip install -e . --no-build-isolation

See `Requirements for Installing Packages <https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/>`_
for more details.


Choosing compilers
==================

NumPy needs C and C++ compilers, and for development versions also needs
Cython.  A Fortran compiler isn't needed to build NumPy itself; the
``numpy.f2py`` tests will be skipped when running the test suite if no Fortran
compiler is available. 

For more options including selecting compilers, setting custom compiler flags
and controlling parallelism, see
https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/building/compilers_and_options.html

Windows
-------

On Windows, building from source can be difficult (in particular if you need to
build SciPy as well, because that requires a Fortran compiler). Currently, the
most robust option is to use MSVC (for NumPy only). If you also need SciPy,
you can either use MSVC + Intel Fortran or the Intel compiler suite.
Intel itself maintains a good `application note
<https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/numpyscipy-with-intel-mkl>`_
on this.

If you want to use a free compiler toolchain, our current recommendation is to
use Docker or Windows subsystem for Linux (WSL).  See
https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/dev/contributor/contributor_toc.html#development-environment
for more details.


Building with optimized BLAS support
====================================

Configuring which BLAS/LAPACK is used if you have multiple libraries installed
is done via a ``--config-settings`` CLI flag - if not given, the default choice
is OpenBLAS. If your installed library is in a non-standard location, selecting
that location is done via a pkg-config ``.pc`` file.
See https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/building/blas_lapack.html for more details.

Windows
-------

The Intel compilers work with Intel MKL, see the application note linked above.

For an overview of the state of BLAS/LAPACK libraries on Windows, see
`here <https://mingwpy.github.io/blas_lapack.html>`_.

macOS
-----

On macOS >= 13.3, you can use Apple's Accelerate library. On older macOS versions,
Accelerate has bugs and we recommend using OpenBLAS or (on x86-64) Intel MKL.

Ubuntu/Debian
-------------

For best performance, a development package providing BLAS and CBLAS should be
installed.  Some of the options available are:

- ``libblas-dev``: reference BLAS (not very optimized)
- ``libatlas-base-dev``: generic tuned ATLAS, it is recommended to tune it to
  the available hardware, see /usr/share/doc/libatlas3-base/README.Debian for
  instructions
- ``libopenblas-base``: fast and runtime detected so no tuning required but a
  very recent version is needed (>=0.2.15 is recommended).  Older versions of
  OpenBLAS suffered from correctness issues on some CPUs.

The package linked to when numpy is loaded can be chosen after installation via
the alternatives mechanism::

    update-alternatives --config libblas.so.3
    update-alternatives --config liblapack.so.3

Or by preloading a specific BLAS library with::

    LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/atlas-base/atlas/libblas.so.3 python ...


Build issues
============

If you run into build issues and need help, the NumPy and SciPy
`mailing list <https://scipy.org/scipylib/mailing-lists.html>`_ is the best
place to ask. If the issue is clearly a bug in NumPy, please file an issue (or
even better, a pull request) at https://github.com/numpy/numpy.
